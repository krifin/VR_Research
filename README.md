Aim: To test our Virtual reality multi-sensorial experience

a revolutionary discovery experience that mixes touch, smell, sound and sight for a fully immersive journey across the world of Metaverse & Gaming.

Virtual reality "Is memory data?" experience
When we were asked by our partners to try to creatively envision the question "Is memory data?", we have to admit - we scratch our heads for a little bit. In the same time, One of the research lab envisioned an activation which would be more of an art installation than your average marketing activation.  What we have envisioned for this project was very simple in its elegance. Using nothing more than a bucket, a garden hose and a virtual reality headset, we have placed the user into the center of the experience in which the element of water was presented in a way not seen before.
Upon placing the VR headset on them, visitors would be asked to place their hands under the running water. Achieving synesthesia while combining the element of water with rich graphical content, we strived to show that there is more to life and living than it can be seen with the naked eye.

To conduct this research study, we plan to work with several pyschologist & neuroscientist & use the Morris Water Maze(MWM) Methodology.

#About Morris Water Maze (MWM)

The Morris Water Maze is a widely used behavioral task in neuroscience for studying spatial learning and memory. This test is based on the fact that an animal will try to escape a stressful situation or stimulus, which in this case is a large pool of water. The pool contains a small platform, either visible above the water level, or just below the surface of the water. This small platform allows the animals to escape the water and allows them to stand without the stress of swimming, and is designed with a mesh or grooved material that allows for easy handling. Pre-training occurs by introducing the location of the escape platform and using a platform that is visible above the water surface. On the following days, the actual test is performed, in which the platform is hidden beneath the water surface. To escape swimming in the water, the animal must remember the location of the escape platform using visual cues in the testing area, which requires use of hippocampal-dependent spatial reference memory, and this ability to remember the location of the platform can be effected by the administration of certain drugs or disease models.

The MWM was first used by Richard Morris at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland in the early 1980s. Since then, it has become one of the most widely used tools in behavioral neuroscience because of its easy of use and training, its many variations, and its ability to test various areas of brain function. Morris published a series of papers describing the maze and its evaluation of hippocampal-dependent learning over several years (Morris 1981, Morris 1982, Morris 1984, Morris 1986). The maze also gained popularity when it was used by Ian Whishaw’s group in Canada (Kolb et al. 1982, Kolb et al. 1983). Since these initial papers, the maze has been used to study various disease models, including endocrine abnormalities, strokes, Alzheimer’s disease, other neurodegenerative diseases, and their effects on learning and memory

##Research_Method

The virtual reality environment can be created as per the need of the experiment. In the Simian version multiple environments can be configured.

The Morris Water Maze (MWM) is a widely used behavioral task developed by Richard G. Morris in the year 1981 as a response to the Radial Arm Maze (RAM). As opposed to the Radial Arm Maze, the Morris Water Maze doesn’t provide the subject with a choice point. Further, the task utilizes the fear of drowning to motivate the subject to learn the location of the escape platform quickly. The navigational task is effective in the assessment of spatial learning, and over the course of years has seen modifications and adaptations such as the Water T-Maze, the Water Y-Maze, and the Water RAM.
